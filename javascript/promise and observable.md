# Promises (one value, one time)
A `Promise` is used for a single asynchronous value that arrives in the future.
|  |  |
|--|--|
| `new Promise()` | Creates a new Promise and provides `resolve`/`reject` |
| `resolve(value)` | Completes the Promise successfully |
| `reject(error)` | Fails the Promise with an error |
| `then()` | Runs when the Promise is resolved |
| `catch()` | Runs if the Promise is rejected |
| `finally()` | Runs after the Promise is settled (success or failure) |
| `await` | Pauses `async` function until the Promise resolves/rejects |
| `async` | Declares a function that returns a Promise and can use . |
# Observables (multiple values over time)
An `Observable` is a stream that can emit multiple values, and you subscribe to receive them.
