# Signals
A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action, when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly
* **Maskable** signals which can be changed or ignored by the user (`CTRL+C`, `CTRL+Z`, e.g.)
* **Non-Maskable** signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user. These typically occur when the user is signaled for non-recoverable hardware errors
## SIGINT
`Ctrl+C`
It will interrupt the application usually causing it to abort, but this is up to the application to decide
## SIGTSTP
`Ctrl+Z`
Sends  to a foreground application, effectively putting it in the background, suspended
By running `fg` or `%job_number` the program can continue running
## SIGSTOP
`Ctrl+S`
Stops the program running without sending it to the background
### SIGCONT
`Ctrl+Q`
Continues the process' execution
