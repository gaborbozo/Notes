# Asynchronous messaging
Traditional concept is a synchronous  blocking call over _HTTP_ using _REST_-ful patterns.

> **Gridlock** refers to a situation where services are waiting on each other in a circular or deadlocked way, causing the whole system (or parts of it) to freeze or stall.

On the other hand asynchronous methology works like 
1. Over **_HTTP_ using _REST_** the client sends a call and the server immediately reponds with an accepted status code. The client then either polls the server or waits for a push message on a callback _URL_ to determine if the work was done and successful or done and failed.
2. Using a **messaging system** like RabbitMQ, Kafka, JMS or others. A message is put on a system and a downstream consumer works on that message. Successes or failures can be communicated many different ways or not at all in these various patterns.
## Message broker
Heart of the system. Translates message from one system into a message for another system. Ensures reliable delivery even if the sender and receiver aren't active at the same time.

Routing can range from simple point-to-point to complex message inspection and fan-out. A message broker handles this, ensuring consumers only receive relevant messages. It can also split or combine messages as needed for efficient delivery. 

These components are a great source for handling and responding errors.

### Terms
**Producer** creates message for another system to act on. It builds the message in the correct format (based on a contract) and dispatches it to the message broker. Once the message is sent, the producer usually confirms acceptance and ends the process.
**Consumer** (or receiver) is the system that receives messages from the message broker. While there are various ways this can happen, the core responsibility of the consumer is to act on the message. After processing, it may either do nothing further (in simple workflows), or it may send a new message â€” either to another system downstream or back to the original sender, often as a response or callback.
**Dead-letter queue** is a special palce in a message broker where error messages go, error such as format issues, timeouts, the queue being so backed up that it cannot accept the message.
### Point-to-point pattern
These calls can replace traditional restful calls between services, where the response is not needed or can be received in and out of band process. 

Single producer creates a message and puts it into the message broker. Single consumer responds or listens to the message and does some action on it.

Important that after the producer creates the message, dispatches it, and goes on.

Any kind of reponse is usually another point-to-point message.
### Publish-subscribe pattern
Single producer - multiple consumer.
