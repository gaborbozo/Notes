Testing is a set of activities to discover defects and evaluate the quality of software artifacts. These artifacts when being tested, are known as test objects.
* Testing not just only consists of executing tests.
* Testing not just entierly focuses on verifying the test object.

Tests needs to be planned, managed, estimated, monitored and controlled.
# Objectives
* Evaluating work products 
* Triggering failures, finding defects
* Ensuring required coverage of a test object (coverage measurement)
* Reducing the level of risk of inadequate software quality
* Verifying whether specified requirements have been fulfilled
* Verifying that a test object compiles with contractual, legal, and regualotry requirements
* Providing information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions
* Building confidence in the quality of the test object
*  Validating whether the test object is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders
# Importance
* Provides cost-eeffective means of detecting defects
* Direct evaluation of the quality of a test object at various stages in the SDLC (Software development life cycle)
# Dynamic and static testings
Static testing will analyze the code, requirements documents and design documents, while dynamic testing will look at the functional behavior of software systems such as memory usage and performance. Static testing essentially gives an assessment of code, while dynamic testing will try to find active bugs.
# QA (prevention) and QC (detection)
QA is a process that tells how the quality requirements of a product can be achieved, techniques, test cases, methods etc. QA activities include defining quality standards and methodologies, implementing processes to ensure compliance with standards, conducting audits and reviews, and setting up frameworks for testing.

QC focuses on identifying defects in the software product through testing and inspection. QC activities include executing test cases, conducting reviews and inspections, performing static and dynamic testing, analyzing results, and reporting defects.

QA defines, QC implements
# Error, defect, failure, root cause
1. Error is an unintentionally mistake
2. Defect is a deviation between expected and actual result
3. Failure is an approach of finding defects
4. If a defect in code is executed, the system may fail to do what is hould do, or do something it should not, causing a failure.
# Principles
1. Testing shows presence of defects, not there absence
