# Interface

## Static methods
Since _Java 8_ can contain. These methods are implementead with a method body (not abstract).

Can only be called on the interface (InterfaceName.staticMethodName).

Cannot be overiden or hidden in the class and belong to the interface.
## Default methods
Before Java 8, all interface methods had to be abstrac. `default` allow for a non-static methods to have a body. 

It allows backward-compatible interface evolution.
